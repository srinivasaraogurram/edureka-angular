Specialization - 3 course series
 The Mastering Angular Development specialization is designed to equip learners with the skills needed to build scalable, high-performance Angular applications. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced developer looking to refine your expertise, this specialization provides training in Angular’s core principles, advanced data handling techniques, testing, and deployment strategies.

Through hands-on projects, real-world case studies, and industry-relevant exercises, you’ll learn how to develop dynamic and responsive web applications, manage complex state with RxJS and NgRx, and ensure robust application performance through testing and optimization techniques.

This specialization comprises three comprehensive courses:

Getting Started with Angular: Build a strong foundation in Angular by exploring its architecture, components, data binding, and essential tools like Angular CLI.

Advanced Data Handling and Reactive Programming Concepts: Master advanced techniques, including RxJS for reactive programming, state management with NgRx, and performance optimization.

Testing and Deploying Angular Applications: Learn to write comprehensive test cases using Jasmine and Karma, optimize applications for production, and automate deployment using CI/CD pipelines.

Join us now and take the next step toward building and deploying production-ready Angular applications with confidence!

Applied Learning Project

Learners will work on hands-on projects covering key aspects of Angular development, including building dynamic web applications, implementing state management solutions, and optimizing performance. The curriculum emphasizes practical problem-solving, equipping learners with the skills to manage complex data structures, integrate APIs, and ensure application reliability.

Through these projects, participants will gain experience in designing scalable and maintainable Angular applications while following best practices for testing and deployment.
